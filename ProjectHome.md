The Rainbow project is an open source initiative to build a comprehensive content management system using Microsoft's ASP.NET and C# technologies. It has ASP.NET 1.1 and ASP.NET 2.0 code bases.

Rainbow, available today in 29 languages, allows content authoring to be safely delegated to role-based team members who need little or no knowledge of HTML. Rainbow optionally supports a two-step approval-publish process. 75 plug-in modules are now included in the standard release, including support for an e-store, XML news feeds, Flash, Maps, Newsletter, Surveys, Forums, Document Management, Custom Lists, and more.

Rainbow has received more than 150,000 downloads to date and is already in production at many commercial internet and intranet sites.

We are always happy to meet people who are really working with the software :)

It would be nice to exchange opinions and experiences. What are your wishes? What could the software do better?

Please join one or more of the following groups:

  * [rainbow-announce@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/rainbow-announce) - Bare bones infos about what is going on. Silence in this group means silence before the storm.
  * [rainbow-users@googlegroup.com](http://groups.google.com/group/rainbow-users) - Installing and using the Rainbow application (including template generation and web design (CSS for that matter))
  * [rainbow-developers@googlegroup.com](http://groups.google.com/group/rainbow-developers) - What is really happening and what is going on in the future
