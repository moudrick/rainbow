1.6.0.1879 - 09/10/2005
by Jakob Hansen
- NEW: Added new module "Admin - Module Definitions - OneFileModules" in folder 
  ModuleDefinitions_OFM. From readme.txt: 

  With this module you install modules based on the OneFileModuleKit. First you must
  copy your file to the server and then you can install it using this module.
  NOTE: This module have no file editing or file creation functionality. You can use
  Notepad to edit your OneFileModule file and use FileManager to move the file (or FTP).

  With this module you do not need to install OneFileModule based modules with 
  the 'Admin - Database Tool' module (and the typical sql from a DBPatch.sql file).

1.6.0.1878f - 07/10/2005
by Hongwei Shen

  tabcontrol.css in default.css. For zen theme, the content of tabcontrol.css was copied 
  to admin.cs of zen-example1 theme.

by Hongwei Shen
- FIX: AddTab.ascs: added and changed two EasyListBoxs' "UseUniqueID" to true to fix the 
       interference of them with property pages. Also reverted settingstable.cs to 
       version 313 to recover the pleasant feature for the property pages. It is 
       tested against all layouts and themes, test result positive for all except zen
       based layouts and themes. The only problem is the settings not in the slide box for
       those themes. I am very sure it is caused by zen theme's css setting.

	   configuration settings in web.config. Associated changes in Rainbow.Settings (smarter 
	   uniqueID routine) and Providers.
	   See: http://support.rainbowportal.net/confluence/display/DOX/Changes+in+Global.asax.cs.

       - Mod_PageManager.css
       - Mod_SmartError.css
       - Mod_Survey.css
       - Mod_Tasks.css
       Some of these files were previously placed (incorrectly and unnecessarily) in a sub-folder called "mod".
       NOTE: I have not made corresponding changes to any other Themes/Layouts - this does need to be done.
       Also Solpart menu CSS has been moved to a separate file (out of Default.css). ModuleSupport.css has been deleted.
       See: http://support.rainbowportal.net/confluence/display/DOX/CSS+Management+in+Rainbow for a complete explanation 
       of proper CSS management. Thanks to Ozan Sirin for the brilliant modification to Page class
       that makes this possible.

1.5.0.1792j - 05/04/2005
by Jes1111
- FIX: Fixed problems with caching - particularly Theme caching, which now correctly
       monitors public and private folders. In debug mode on VS, caching now sends
       messages to Output window so you can watch everything happening in the cache
       (including a callback so you see when items expire on time, etc). Associated
       changes in Rainbow.Settings project.
- FIX: Corrected Helpers/XslHelper.BuildUrl method so it now makes proper use of 
       latest Rewriter. 
- FIX: Small changes to PortalTabsXml, Zen DLL and ZenNavigation/*.xslt so ZenNavigation
       and 'classic' navigation should now produce identical results - but exact degree
       of correlation is currently untested.
       NOTE: it is possible to use accented characters in URL's although it looks ugly
       when they are Http encoded. ASP.NET 2 has a new 'translate' function to map 
       accented characters to their unaccented equivalents - something to look forward
       to.

1.5.0.1791b - 24/01/2005
by John Mandia (www.whitelightsolutions.com)
- NEW: 2 controls added for advanced users and testers (They are not used by default)
  SmartScroller (A control you can drop onto DesktopDefault.aspx so that you retain 
  scroll position after postback seems to work on firefox and ie - I've lost the url for the 
  source of this control if you find it please add here.)
  Custom Form (From www.metabuilders.com) this lets you set action="" which 
  prevents ?tabid=x&etc on postback on friendly urls (Note that this needs testing. 
  If you have a login on homepage it could throw a viewstate error. This is for evaluation 
  and advanced users only).

e.g. 

<%@ Page language="C#" SmartNavigation="False" CodeBehind="DesktopDefault.aspx.cs" AutoEventWireup="false" Inherits="Rainbow.DesktopDefault"%>
<%@ Register TagPrefix="rbc" Namespace="Rainbow.UI.WebControls" Assembly="Rainbow" %>
<HTML>
	<head runat="server"></head>
	<body runat="server">
	<rbc:CustomForm runat="server" action="">
		
			<asp:PlaceHolder id="LayoutPlaceHolder" runat="server"></asp:PlaceHolder>
		<rbc:SmartScroller runat="server"/>
	</rbc:customform>	
	</body>
</HTML>

- ENH: UrlProviders now support cache time and invalidation (UrlBuilder exposes a 
       Clear method to clean out stored Url Elements e.g. HttpUrlBuilder.Clear(tabId). 
       This is called from TabSettings when an update occurs.
       If you don't want to set a time expiration on Url Elements set cache time to 0 (submitted for testing).
- ENH: Tabsettings: Url Page Name and Url Keyword moved to Navigation Settings 
       instead of Meta Settings (As they are url settings)
- ENH: On 3 Panes Layouts/Themes if a module does not load up and you are part of 
       the admins group you get the error message so you have some idea of what went wrong.

1.5.0.1791a - 24/01/2005

- FIX : Remove Module librarys from cvs
- FIX : Add removed files to .cvsignore

1.5.0.1791 - 24/01/2005
by John Mandia (www.whitelightsolutions.com)
- NEW & MOD : Seperated all modules into private assemblies from the core 
        (Apart from workflow and LanguageSwitcher as these are called from the core)
        Created Solution file for each module and also one in the root of DesktopModules 
        which lets you build all modules in one go.
        Updated history.xml so that it will reinstall all modules and pick up the new dlls. 
        All modules now have dlls in the following format Rainbow.Modules.ModuleName.dll 
        Namespaces are still kept the same to reduce the change of any breaking changes. 
        All projects deploy to bin folder and have been setup as debug type of url pointing 
        at http://localhost/rainbow/default.aspx (This lets you debug individual modules).
        Nant build scripts still need to be changed to reflect the change.
        This dramtically increases the number of dlls in the bin folder (There are 67 new dlls) 
        and highlights the fact that there are a lot of modules bundled in the core. 
        This gives people the choice of only having the modules they are interested in 
        (they can uninstall modules and remove non essential modules from the bin folder)
        It also means we can update modules without having to re-release the core 
        (So minor updates can be done on a per module basis and if you do not use that 
        module you do not need to do an update).

1.5.0.1790a - 23/01/2005
by Mike Stone
- NEW : Added a new DataType CheckBoxListDataType which of course allows us to pass in
        datasource and Value and Text. You can then select more then one item. 
	for more information see Jira Issue RBP-632 

1.5.0.1790 - 23/01/2005
by Jakob Hansen
- NEW : Added new module "Quote". From the readme.txt:
        Display a random text string, e.g.: "Not all who wander are lost -- Tolkien".
        The text is read from a file or entered by the user. It is possible to select other 
        files than the provided demo file. You can control the size of the text and if the
        the text should be in italic and/or bold. A set of userdefined start and end html tags 
        are provided for customizing.
        IMPORTANT NOTES: 
	1) Add manually. To avoid causing problems for RC4 you have to add to module manually.
	2) This new module does not use the database for anything apart from the Setting system

1.5.0.1789h - 22/01/2005
by Mike Stone

        if you tried to intall the modules again there was an error. YOU DO NOT

- FIX : Jira RBP-545 Update of DB in multi-DB environment

by John Mandia (www.whitelightsolutions.com)
1.5.0.1788k - 07/01/2005
- FIX: Now there is only one "UseAlias" entry (it is in Rainbow.config). This will be there until code dependancies 
	   have been fixed/altered.
- ENH: Updated UrlBuilder and Rewriter Dlls - Now have shorter friendlier urls by default!!
	   e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/site/1/default.aspx
  	   IMPORTANT NOTE: Updates to web.config must be looked at. UrlBuilder Provider and Rewriter Rules now have more settings.
   	   Since Urls are treated differently now (there is a setting that can switch between having tabid appear as other 
   	   querystrings e.g /tabid__1/default.aspx or at the end of the url e.g. /1/default.aspx
       There is a new handler flag "site" for UrlBuilder and Rewriter and the legacy rewrite rule entry has been updated
       to catch any cached urls/favourites (legacy rules' urlhandler flag is "portal" - the old handler flag [if you had 
       changed this to something else then please change it in legacy rule too!!!])
	   e.g. I had a site with a urlhandler flag of "john" (instead of portal). So I change the legacy rewrite rule 
	   handlerflag from "portal" to "john".
	   I still want my name in the url so I change the new urlbuilder handlerflag and rewrite default rule handlerflag
	   to "johnm" instead of "site".
	   Now all my sites urls will be www.domain.com/johnm/1/default.aspx etc and any cached links or favourites pointing
	   to www.domain.com/john/tabid_1/default.aspx will still work (since the legacy rule will catch it and handle it).                   
- Removed: <add key="TabSettingsCacheKey" value="_GetTabSettings_" /> from Rainbow.config as providers and external urls
	   now use the Rainbow.Settings.dll for cache keys.

1.5.0.1788e - 05/01/2005

- ENH : Update FCKEditor V2. Added more langs and fixed problems found. 

1.5.0.1788d - 05/01/2005
by John Mandia (www.whitelightsolutions.com)
- ENH : Updated rewrite rules and urlbuilder rule so that rule specific settings are now longer in rainbow.config
	    (they are defined with the rule [see bottom of web.config]).
	    Only the general Target Handler Page is left in rainbow.config.
- MOD : Set alias and lang setting to false by default (If you site uses more than one language it is best to be
	    on otherwise you'll get shorter uls leaving it off.
	    Having alias set to true may give you a very marginal performance boost but again makes the urls very long).
        cached urls (e.g. with lang and or alias in them) in search engines etc will still work on your site with
        these settings set to false.

1.5.0.1788c - 04/01/2005
by John Mandia - (www.whitelightsolutions.com)
- FIX : Improved performance of UrlBuilder Provider. In extensions I have updated the provider. There is a commented
		out implementation that use cache dependancy (dependant on tabsettings cache) but that doesn't seem to work
		(if anyone can see why I'd love to know). I've added an alternative solution which caches the url values:
		IsPlaceHolder, TabLink, Page Name and Url Keywords (so that it doesn't hit the db on every request).
		The cache time in minutes can be set via provide settings (It defaults to 5 mins).
- ENH : Added commented out code in HttpUrlBuilder for testing. The ability to preserve querystring values across
		modules on the same page. 
		e.g. you have Enhanced html (using querystring values to pass page id etc while staying on the same tab) and
		another module that uses the same technique (change module state without leaving the current tab).
		Before if you clicked a link on the enhanced html module (e.g. page 2) and then clicked on a link of another
		module on the same page you would lose the enhanced html state e.g. it would go back to page 1 (default state).
       	HttpUrlBuilder will now remember and add querystring values that were already set. This still needs testing
       	(which is why I commented it out. Simply uncomment and build rainbow).

MAJOR move on cvs repository.

The changes have propagated correctly.

FOR CVS DEVELOPER WITH WRITE ACCESS:
BACKUP YOUR LOCAL COPY BEFORE GET NEW CVS.

I strongly suggest to get CVS again in a fresh folder.

Anyway, if you keep it remove the following directories:
cvsroot/rainbowportal/CVSROOT/Rainbow/BLL
/cvsroot/rainbowportal/CVSROOT/Rainbow/Configuration
/cvsroot/rainbowportal/CVSROOT/Rainbow/Helpers
/cvsroot/rainbowportal/CVSROOT/Rainbow/KickStarter
/cvsroot/rainbowportal/CVSROOT/Rainbow/Security
/cvsroot/rainbowportal/CVSROOT/Rainbow/Service
/cvsroot/rainbowportal/CVSROOT/Rainbow/UI
/cvsroot/rainbowportal/CVSROOT/Rainbow/Ecommerce

Note: if you get:
Value cannot be null. Parameter name: Resource not found: Rainbow.UI.WebControls.client_scripts.confirmDelete.js 
Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. 
Exception Details: System.ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null. Parameter name: Resource not found: Rainbow.UI.WebControls.client_scripts.confirmDelete.js

You must upgrade your custom module to point to correct resource:
Replace all "Rainbow.UI.WebControls.client_scripts.confirmDelete.js", "Rainbow.app_code.Rainbow.UI.WebControls.client_scripts.confirmDelete.js"

the new repository module to get for have ecommerce is rainbowmodules

1.4.0.1773v - 16/09/2004
by Jes
- FIX: default DOCTYPE was causing problems with classic themes. 
	   The DOCTYPE default is now an empty string. If the current
	   theme is a Zen type and the Site Settings DOCTYPE has not been
	   set then a value is pulled from Zen Settings in Rainbow.config and
	   used. Note that this still means if you DO set a value in Site
	   Settings which does NOT force Standards Compliance mode then Zen
	   themes will not work properly.

1.4.0.1773u - 15/09/2004
by Jes
- FIX: fixed problem with Tabs module rendering. Something I added in 
	   new PortalModuleControl was to wrap each module in a DIV: the 
	   actual form is <div id="mID[nnnn]" class="[moduleType]>...</div>,
	   where 'nnnn' is the moduleID and moduleTYpe is the name of the 
	   type of module. Both of these values help with 'advanced' CSS 
	   styling ... you can apply certain CSS rules to one module instance
	   only by prefixing a CSS rule with #mIDnnnn (for example: 
			#mID1028 p{color:Red} 
	   would make paragraph text red in module with ID of 1028 only. This
	   is the basis of the new Custom Theme per Module capability. The other
	   attribute (class="...") is similar but broader in scope ... you can 
	   specify that paragraph text is red in ALL instances of HtmlModule with
	   a CSS rule like: 
			.HtmlModule p{color:red}
	   Of course, that was the problem with the Tabs module ... the CSS class 
	   name of "Tabs" was already used... and was being applied to the whole
	   module, causing rendering to mess up ... so I've modified the code so it
	   uses the full internal name, e.g HtmlModule_ascx. This will avoid conflicts
	   and means that to specify a CSS rule to a specific module type you would use:
			.HtmlModule_ascx p{color:red}
	   Same effect...no conflict ;-)

1.4.0.1771b - 17/08/2004
by John Mandia (www.whitelightsolutions.com)
- Fixed: a bug in AddModule (Naming of Center Pane was wrong. It still showed up on a tab but not via the tablayout aspx page).
- ENH: Enhanced the tablayout page to be similar to my Add Module Module. You can now select default view pemissions and location via dropdown menus.
- Changed: PortalModuleControl.cs It had a hardcoded check to see if modules marked as Admin Modules were being viewed by a role other than Admins if they were not in Admins then they were rejected (I think this is because TabLayout used to give "All Users" default viewing permissions for all modules added. You can now control that via enhancement mentioned). This has been commented out as there may be situations where you want someone to use an admin module but dont want to give them full rights.
NOTE: PLEASE CHECK YOUR SITE. IF YOU HAVE ADMIN MODULES ON NORMAL TABS AND YOU HAVE NOT UPDATED VIEW PERMISSIONS TO REMOVE ALL USERS THEN THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR ADMIN MODULE. LOGOUT OF YOUR SITE AND BROWSE THE PAGES WHERE YOU PLACED ADMIN MODULES TO ENSURE THEY ARE NOT VIEWABLE BY ALL USERS.

1.4.0.1771a - 16/08/2004
by John Mandia (www.whitelightsolutions.com)
- Added Introduction Help File For Role Assignment Module (Xsl for help system still needs to be done).

1.4.0.1771 - 15/08/2004
by John Mandia (www.whitelightsolutions.com)

- Tidied up Admin & AdminAll Folders (Removed aspx pages that were no longer used, Moved all modules to DesktopModules to have 1 place for all modules).
- Appended "Admin - " To all modules that may give average users too much power (e.g. The DB Tool module) and marked them as Admin Modules.
- Fixed unknown bug in Security.cs (When checking for publish permissions it was calling the wrong stored procedure).
- Removed a duplicate stored procedure (Checked code to make sure there were no references to it - rb_GetAuthPublishRoles).
- Added Additional methods to Security.cs to allow the retrieval of roles for different types of permissions easily.
- Added Additional methods to UsersDB.cs: GetUsersNoRole (Retrieve all users who are not assigned to a particular group) and GetRoleNonMembers (Retrieve all 
  users who do not belong to the role specified) and added two stored procedures to support this methods.
- Added New Module - Role Assignment (Allows you to easily add or remove a user or multiple users to/from a role and allows you to assign users who have no role to a role. 
- Added a foundation for a help system so people can start to add help documentation for their modules (Soon to be followed by core help files and extension help files).
  A new directory now exists "Documentation" within that are 4 folders: Core, Extensions, Modules and Style. Currently only Modules and Style will be used. Create a folder 
  in "Modules" that matches the name of the modules' folder in DesktopModules. Add an image folder to it if you will use images. 
  Create a help doc in DITA format (http://xml.coverpages.org/dita.html). I recommend using the Desktop version of authentic® 2004 
  (You can download a free version from http://www.altova.com/download_authentic.html). You can either use the existing DITA example as a template or create a new one.
  Save the xml file as Documentation.xml to /Documentation/Modules/YourModule/ and then rename the file to Documentation.resx (This is to prevent people from downloading your
  documentation via a direct url. It still opens up in VS and in notepad, just don't include it into the Rainbow project as VS will complain). The current stylesheet used is 
  very basic (I'll be adding a better one before RC4) .
- Added New Module - Add Module (This module can be dropped onto a tab to allow users to add modules directly. It has many features. To read the help file (looks ugly at the 
  moment, select Admin - Add Module in the drop-down menu and it will detect that this module has a help file [ So you can see what a module does before adding it]).
- I plan to add support for documentation to existing modules before RC4 (but this isn't done yet). 
- Dropped TabAdmistration as the New "Add Module" and Move Module arrows replace this functionality.

1.4.0.1769d - 11/07/2004
by John Mandia (www.whitelightsolutions.com)
-ENH: Created a module based on the tab layout page. Module is not installed by default as I just built it 
      today and would like people the option on whether or not they want it installed. If you want to install 
      it go to adminall, go to the add module page and add the path to the module i.e. /DesktopModules/TabAdministration/install.xml
      This lets you drop tab administration on a single tab, multiple tabs or all tabs (by using the show on every tab option).
      It also allows you to create groups other than admin that have the right to add, move or delete modules on a current tab 
      (It also improves site administration by removing the number of clicks required).

1.4.0.1764i - 06/06/2004
by Jakob Hansen (All issues are about the Tasks module - all coding done by Chris Farrell!)
- FIX: Fixed "Improper Identity Seed for ItemID in table rb_Tasks".
- FIX: TasksView.aspx was not wrapping Description field text.
- ENH: Added support for WYSIWYG HTML text editors for "descriptionfield".
- FIX: TasksView.aspx. Removed the "if(ItemID != 0)" block.  There was an
   improper coding of the Identity seed for ItemID so valid items might have a
   ItemID = 0. There is no reason that the TasksView.aspx page should not display 
   where ItemID = 0 so this helps offset the hassle of this bug for users who already 
   have data present.

Warning: The setup script currently fails on fresh databases due to a few changes. To get it to run, strip out references to the newsletter module and shortcut module from the history.xml file. We are looking into it and hope to fix it soon.

ECommerce in a private assembly:

  A project has been added to the Solution Rainbow.ECommerce as a private assembly
  The project is in the ECommerce directory (we do not want to move many files so we leave everything in place)
  Add a web share on /Ecommerce as /localhost/ECommerce for the project to open
  
  The /Secure directory has been moved as /ECommerce/Secure to avoid a second private assembly
  When making changes, Rainbow.ECommerce.dll has to be copied from /ECommerce/bin to /bin no other files need to be moved.
  
  NOTE: code for cart migration has been commented out in security.cs, this need to be fixed ! the cart will not be saved
  when the user logs in!

  - ItemNavigation.cs and ShopNavigation.cs moved in /UI/Webcontrols as also used by SimpleMenu module
  - ProductLayouts needs to reference Rainbow.ECommerce.dll instead of Rainbow.dll as a assembly
  - web.config : shipping object in the Rainbow.ECommerce.dll assembly

[ 868458 ] change Module Name  
[ 759161 ] erasing roles (Now a friendly message is shown when trying to erase a role that is linked to users) 
Unknown Bug: In Newsletter it used it's friendly name instead of it's GUID.

- Enhancements:

- Url Keywords Now Work (I know it's been a while :D but now when you add a url keyword on a tab it will show up in the url.
  Note: Portal Level Url Keyword has been removed (Otherwise it would involve a lot of checking for each url on the page). This feature makes use of caching to make it as fast as possible.

- Multiple Databases with a single source code. Now you can have multiple portals in a database with one source, single portal in a database with a single source, or multiple portals in multiple databases with a single source.
- This is a new feature so please log any problems on sourceforge.
- To have a second db, here is an example. 
  Customer www.mydomain.com wants their own database. 
  You Create A Database in SQL Server MyDomainDB. 
  You add the following setting to web.config: <add key="mydomain_ConnectionString" value="server=localhost;database=MyDomainDB;uid=sa;pwd=" />   
  It should take you to the setup page where you run the setup scripts (If it doesn't change the defaultportal setting in web.config to mydomain [if you have the settings strip www & .com]).
  If you do not enter mydomain_ConnectionString in web.config it will use the default ConnectionString setting.

IMPORTANT!!!!
This is the first relase in vs 2003 format.
As a result of a survey on mailing list 99% of developers use vs 2003
The default framework now is 1.1
You can still use 1.0 and VS 2002
http://www.codeproject.com/macro/openvc.asp

NOTE 2:
Wit version 1.1 some xml warning arise.
I cannot fix them without broking compatiblit with v.1.0
Regard xml warnings see this post:
http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/messageboard/Thread.aspx?id=145360
It is not ranbow but the problem is the same

NOTE 3:
I have marked as obsolete some loggin code.
Right now ignore the warning.

- ENH: Improved custom registration modules. 
       In the old way custom pages cannot have custom settings.

       Current way to add register module (still ok)
       - You must place you custom page in DesktopModules\Register folder
       - Your custom page must be control named Register<....>.ascx (start with Register word)
       - Your control must implement IEditUserProfile interface
       - Your control may or may not be compiled with Rainbow (it can be in its own dll)
       - On Portalsettings select you control from the menu.
       
       Using custom settings:
       - You must register your control as a standard module
       - Add it to a page (hidden usually)
       - Change your settings
       - Record the module number (mid in querystring in property page)
       - On Portalsettings fill the Register module ID box with the number.

1.3.0.1751b - 4/11/2003
by john.mandia@whitelightsolutions.com
- Fix: Country Drop Down is now in correct aplhabetical order on RegisterFull, E-Commerce Page and On Site Settings (Thank you Manu for updating Esperantus :D to allow sorting)
       http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=759955&group_id=66837&atid=515929
- Fix: On fresh Db builds country list now appears (I have updated the localize script to include rb_Localize info)
       http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=833603&group_id=66837&atid=515929
- Minor Fix: Commented out an entry in Country script (Country TP entry) as it didn't have any values and caused a blank entry to appear in the country drop down menu.
- Fix: Bad BankGateway.dll reference (This should now be fixed)
       http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=833251&group_id=66837&atid=515929
- Bug Closed: PortalSecurity.Security - Access Denied throws errors (This has been resolved via the error handler...if you see the access denied error instead of the friendly page please check web.config settings (you may be browsing locally)
       http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=791976&group_id=66837&atid=515929
- Bug Closed: Query Strings Corrupted by URL Rewriting

       If you wish to pass query strings to a module on DesktopDefault.aspx please Use the urlbuilder and pass the values via customAttributes e.g. customAttributes = "CustomerID=44" or for 
       multiple values: customAttributes would equal "CustomerID=44/ParentCompanyID=1/ThirdOption=This". 

       If you are passing querystrings to a custom page....e.g. from a module to customfolder/mycustompage.aspx then still use urlbuilder to pass this custom url. You pass it as tagetPage to url builder e.g. "~/customfolder/custompage.aspx" The "/" in the targerpage 
       will let UrlBuilder know that it is not DesktopDefault and will build the url appropriately.
       To pass a querystring to this targetpage please still use customAttributes with the same format e.g. 1 querystring would be "CustomerID=44" and two would be "CustomerID=44/ParentCompanyID=1" and three would be "CustomerID=44/ParentCompanyID=1/ThirdOption=This".
       
       http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=827537&group_id=66837&atid=515929
- ENH: Another HeaderMenu enhancement. I noticed that this control binds oninit which is great because you simply drop it on a page and set the properties. However if you wish to use it in a module, your settings (Via the property page) will never
       be applied as it takes either the settings hardcoded or the defaults. I added an extra property DataBindOnInit and moved the binding code from OnInit to DataBind (but kept a call to DataBind within OnInit). This property lets you simply say DataBindOnInit=false (true is the default) when you add it to your module (Then in the module's codebehind file you can call DataBind() after your custom settings have been applied. 
       So now you can decide if you wish it to bind automatically or when you call DataBind().  
-Note: For those of you creating a fresh db I recommend waiting for Manu's additions to the solutions bug (related tables & sps are not in new db's and will create an error when you try to add a new portal). Please rebuild the solution to ensure that you have the correct dlls (Mine are .Net 1.1).

1.3.0.1751a - 1/11/2003
by john.mandia@whitelightsolutions.com
- Fix: After allow no new registrations is ticked people could not edit their profile
       http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=799945&group_id=66837&atid=515929
- ENH: Made TabKeyPhrase Setting Localized and Created a TabKeyPhrase Module so users can add it to certain tabs or show on all tabs (via the property setting).
       Added it's entry in the xml file so it is installed on fresh builds (Please install it via admin all if you are using a current version).
- ENH: Added rb_PageKeyPhrase to all theme's css file (To control the format of the keyphrase. Entry currently empty).

       http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=833610&group_id=66837&atid=515929
- ENH: Enhanced Header Menu so that you now have more control (Can additionally control visibility of Edit Profile Link, Welcome, LogOff and Save Desktop.
- ENH: Now each portal can have it's own personalised favicon.ico file (Before every portal shared the root one). Just upload your custom favicon to the root of the portal's custom folder e.g. _Rainbow
- Fix: Bug where state would continue to show even if the country had no states. E.g. selecting Italy would show a second dropdown menu (State). If you then selected United Kingdom you would still see the Italian state dropdown which was confusing for users.It now gets hidden if no states are available.
- Temp Bug/Fix: Currently countries do not show on register full and site settings if you create a fresh db. This is because the Localize table is not populated. 
                As a temporary fix you can transfer the data from the Localize table on an old (upgraded) rainbow db to the freshly installed one. Or you can look at setup script 1.2.8.1505_02.sql; part of it populates the Localize table [please only run the relevant part].
                Only do this as an urgent fix as an official one should be released soon. 
-Note: Since I run on .Net 1.1 please recompile the dlls ;-)

		<add key="CreditTransfer" value="Rainbow.ECommerce.GatewayCreditTransfer,DUEMETRI.Rainbow.ECommerce.BankGateway.dll" />

by Manu
- Now I use log4net for loaggin/debug actions, new settings on web.config
- clean install without pass trought all updates
- All modules have they own install (even if admin)
- Clean installation is done by each module's individual script?
- I have fixed some mistakes in current individual install and completed missing one
- One minor change that can have a deep impact anyway, I tried to make all names consistent across rb
  We have a lot of mixed cases and I hope now only few are left... The bigger trouble was with Id
  sometimes written ID, ID id.... so I have changed all in a consistent way
  Pascal or CamelCase (public or private) for all, code and procedures: PortalID, TabID, and so on
  No problem for db, but some properties name are changed. 
  Nothing too bad... recompile and fix some case and should be enough for custom modules. 
  Core modules are ok...

1.2.8.1745 - 25/09/2003
by Thierry (thierry@tiptopweb.com.au)
- FIX: user administration, bug causing deletion of registered users
  in the 'Manage User' module loading 'RegisterFull.ascx', if we edit one user and
  then edit another user, the first user is deleted from the database.
  tricky effect of default parameter in rb_UpdateUserFull: set it in the code (RegisterFull.ascx.cs) 
  instead of relying on SQL stored proc
- FIX: when deleting a role already assigned to some users, there is an exception
  modify rb_DeleteRole so that is removed the role for the users first and then remove the role.

1.2.8.1744a - 16/10/2003
by Manu
Setup/Update.asp script UPDATED
- FIX: Runtime error when installing modules in update.aspx.cs
- FIX: Running order of update scripts. 
  If you have multiple scripts for the same version please read the note:
  The version are automatically sorted at runtime so you must remember to increment 
  the <Version> as well. It is a string value so you may simply append an alpha letter.
  If the Ids are equals the versions are compared.
  Note that this is a defferen behavior then before, where order was based on script name.
  This was necessary because the script name can be omitted now.
- ENH: no more need to run a separate procedure on db. Simple do a clean db and run rainbow.
- ENH: setup.bat does not apply the rbversion script anymore (moved to code)
- ENH: Setup scripts are in a scrollable window now

       http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=807858&group_id=66837&atid=515929
       I have spent a lot of time reviewing all code. I hope I had made no mistakes (sometimes
       I had to change the program itself to make it working).
       For all developers: please be careful and close all datareader you use, either after
       reading and after DataBinding(). http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/msgs/4/24934.aspx
       I hope have not missed one. I have fixed 52 issues in 34 different files.
       Please let me know if some was left or if the new code behaves strangley.

Setup/Update.asp script UPDATED
- New features in update code:
- Version in script is now optional. Update runs a script against db for include the
  current version entry. You need manually insert version only if you skip install.
- Script version is checked against code before each run. 
  This means that you can update many versions with the same script. 
  Very useful if you want update the initial script that creates the db.
  Scenario: 
  You want provide a convenient way for your users for apply updates and you want
  provide a fresh installation script that just do all with few instructions.
  You do two scripts.
  One, named eg: 1.1.7.0000.sql that creates db structure updated to 1734. 
  The last row must contain something like:
  INSERT INTO [rb_Versions] ([Release],[Version],[ReleaseDate]) VALUES('1734','1.2.8.1734', CONVERT(datetime, '09/11/2003', 101))
  GO
  
  One or more scripts as usual for updating existing versions.
  At runtime on clean machine present the list of ALL scripts.
  Then the 1.1.7.0000.sql runs and updates the version. At this point the row updates tha version.
  When setup go to next script it see that this does not need any update and skips it.
  On more recent systems (eg: 1730) all updates are run.  
  
- You can now include modules in a single installation. This is great because
  we can easily move the code for modules on the module itself. No more need for
  refreshing db settings as in 1.2.8.1742.
  Please note in the sample below that in version 1.2.8.1743 we can even omit the script
  and install only modules. 
  
  New syntax:
  	<Release>
		<ID>1742</ID>
		<Version>1.2.8.1742</Version>
		<Script>1.2.8.1742.sql</Script>
		<Date>2003-10-08T00:00:00.0000000+01:00</Date>
	</Release>
	<Release>
		<ID>1743</ID>
		<Version>1.2.8.1743</Version>
		<Date>2003-10-08T00:00:00.0000000+01:00</Date>
		<Modules>
			<Installer>DesktopModules/XmlModule/installer.xml</Installer>
			<Installer>DesktopModules/Pictures/installer.xml</Installer>
		</Modules>
	</Release>
 
  If present sql script is always run BEFORE installing modules.
  You can make however 2 entries for the same version.
  Sample:
  
	<!-- This section is run before -->
	<Release>
		<ID>1555</ID>
		<Version>1.2.8.1555</Version>
		<Date>2003-10-08T00:00:00.0000000+01:00</Date>
		<Script>1.2.8.1555_before.sql</Script>
		<Modules>
			<Installer>DesktopModules/XmlModule/installer.xml</Installer>
			<Installer>DesktopModules/Pictures/installer.xml</Installer>
		</Modules>
	</Release>
	<!-- This script will be run AFTER MODULE installation -->
  	<Release>
		<ID>1555</ID>
		<Version>1.2.8.1555a</Version>
		<Script>1.2.8.1555_after.sql</Script>
		<Date>2003-10-08T00:00:00.0000000+01:00</Date>
	</Release>

  Anyway the version are automatically sorted at runtime so
  you must remember to increment the <Version> as well. It is a string value 
  so you may simply append an alpha letter. If the Ids are equals the versions are compared.
  Note that this is a defferen behavior then before, where order was based on script name.
  This was necessary because the script name can be omitted now.
  
  Other changes:
  - Added EmptyModule template on Desktopmodules (not on project)
  Use it as base for you own modules-
  - Minor bug fix in Install Module code.

1.2.8.1736d - 17/09/2003
by Thierry (thierry@tiptopweb.com.au)
- FIXED: E-Commerce product module
  from Mario (thanks!)
  problem was: some redirections to the home page from a category without using the url handler
  in itemnavigation.cs replace Default.aspx by DesktopDefault.aspx as we are loosing the form parameters
  with the server transfer from Default.aspx to DesktopDefault.aspx and not using the UrlBuilder
- FIXED: E-Commerce product module
  paging of products is now working (like the picture album)

1.2.8.1736c - 16/09/2003
by Thierry (thierry@tiptopweb.com.au)
- FIXED : ECommerce-Product module is now working WITHOUT the url builder
  (it was redirecting to the home page for any action)
  you need to replace in all your DesktopLayout for a shop : shopnavigation (shopnavigatio.cs) control
  by itemnavigation control (itemnavigation.cs). itemnavigation derives from menunavigation
  but the navigation will not be effective and instead we navigate to the same page
  and transmit the tabID as a ItemID (the category of products)
  file shopnavigation.cs has been removed from CVS, itemnavigation.cs moved to ECommerce/UI
  Apology to Mario (who did this good code coding) and all:  I did not realised the change was not in the layout
  last minute : there are still some redirections to the home page from a category without using the url handler
  
1.2.8.1736B - 15/09/2003
cory isakson, added overrides for WebCompile Feature

by Thierry (thierry@tiptopweb.com.au)
- added all files from mario@hartmann.net to project (see below)
  also modified history.xml to take new script 1736
- FIXED: Product module rewritten to use events instead of redirections (the dot net way), 
  this should make it work with framework 1.1
  as there is no more parameters to decode from the command line beside the usual tabID and ItemID
- ENH: added webcontrols ProductAddToCart, ProductImageGoToDetails and ProductLinkGoToDetails to be
  used in /Design/ProductLayouts
  This controls are raising custom events that BUBBLE to this product.ascx control (see OnBubbleEvent)
- NOTE: the ProductAddToCart will NOT work if used in DefaultProductView.ascx
  it has been added as a LinkButton with an event handler at the bottom of the html page and is
  displayed when displaying a product details
- NOTE: look at the ProductLayouts\DefaultProductLayoutView.ascx and DefaultThumbnailView.ascx
  for an example of how to use the new custom controls, you will need to modify your Layouts the same way

1.2.8.1727e - 04/07/2003
by Thierry (Tiptopweb)
- FIX: Switching the DesktopLayout and Theme for an individual page working again :)
  This was creating problems within a portal or accross portals
  Cache removed in PortalSetting.cs for Hashtable GetTabBaseSettings()
  (This is not loosing much on performance as not involving the DB, DB still read with or without cache)
  The problem is : we have new settings that were possibly not there with a database
  created a while ago (no problem with a database created after the new settings were introduced
  when we cache this part of the code, the hashtable is not flushed
  Then we read the database to set again the settings, unfortunately for some pages, the settings
  does not exist in the database and they will not be reset to an null value (even with the code
  added at the end in GetTabCustomSettings()
  consequence the values of the settings will stick
  the effect will be that a custom Layout for example will persist
  on pages without a custom layout setting, for a page created in the database
  before the introduction of the Custom Layout settings
  the problem will be the same with the Metadata and Culture Settings or any future new settings
  *** TODO : put back the cache in GetTabBaseSettings() and modify GetTabCustomSettings()
  to reset values not found in the database, if this is a better solution

1.2.8.1727d - 04/07/2003
by Thierry (Tiptopweb)
- FIX: move code to switch Layout from DesktopLayout.aspx.cs to PortalSettings
       todo: still a bug, as Layout is cached in CustomSettings and layout not reinitialised if empty

1.2.8.1727c - 30/06/2003
- FIX: Changed default connection string to dbo (SQL Authentication)
       Refer to http://www.rainbowportal.net/Rainbow/DesktopModules/ArticlesView.aspx?ItemID=36&mid=10440
       For changing existing connections strings. Having mixed owners it is not recommended.

1.2.8.1727b - 29/06/2003
- FIX: Bug on optimization. PortalUrlDataType bug caused an infinite loop.
- ENH: Some more optimizations on code. 
       Cached all frequently accessed data (portalsettings, Tabsetting, Themeslist).
       Test measure: from 1,77 (1727) to 0,09 (1727b) per request (seconds)
       (Aqtime measurement - your time may be different)
- ENH: Restored DesktopTabsXml. You need to enable it on web.config

1.2.8.1727a - 27/06/2003
by Manu
- Performance gain.
  Analyzed code and done some optimizations. Basically on data types.
  This should not affect functionality. 
  Anyway Application test centers says that code moved from 
  1 avg request per second (1718) 
  to
  12,03 request per second (1727a) on my test machine
- FIX: esperantus. Display name now lookups COUNTRY_CountryInfo.Name. 
  It avoids conflicts with existing keys.
- FIX: Multiple UI languages with same name allowed even it is not recommended.
       Remember that only first one will be looked up.
       Anyway having multiple now does not lead to ugly errors.

1.2.8.1721a - 25/06/2003
by john.mandia@whitelightsolutions.com
Added script 1.2.8.1718.sql to the xml file in setup/scripts as it was creating the views required and was generating an error.
For those who have already gone beyond this number in your version table you may need to run this script manually (Exlude the part where it updates the version table).

1.2.8.1721 - 25/06/2003
by Manu
Enhanced Language switcher
One big problem in previous implementation is the 2 list setting the is not so user-friendly. 
List must match, culture must contain only specific cultures, list must match in number... 
many ting to remember. An error here and you have to change db manually. 
So I decided to do a simpler code for managing cultures. 
This will affect essentially language switcher and portal settings. 
I have removed almost all properties: I saved only one CULTURELIST.
We have a list, the list has 2 columns: one for ui, one for formatting. 
(This follows NET UICulture and Culture)
Something like: it=it-IT;en=en-US 
First is ui, second is formatting. 
You can do also: it=en-US;en=en-US, keys in italian, formatting in US. 
You cannot have duplicate values in first column: en=en-GB;en=en-US is not allowed 
or, better, the second one is ignored. 
Here it is how lookup should work: Rainbow get a language request. 
It may be (in this order)
1) Querystring (lang key)
2) Cookie
3) Browser languages if avaulable (it looks up to find best match - not only first - all vaules are considered)
4) Default value (first in list)
It gets a valid CultureInfo value (invalid values are ignored). 
First lookup search for best match. en will match en and no other. 
(The List is sortable, position matters).
If not found it tries a more loosely match: if we search for en the first "child" (culture that has en as parent, like en-US) will be returned. 
The looked up column is the first one (UI column). 
When match is found set UI (keay and content) to first column, formatting culture to second one.... 
This method give us the freedom of choosing a custom pair. 
Consider a specific example of site: usually an user wants a generic English, 
maybe with the possibility of choose if it is GB or US. 
In language switcher flag can only be specific culture -- there is no "Portuguese" flag, 
only Portugal flag or Brazil flag so the name comes from first column but flag can only 
come from second one. 
My proposal is plain and easy: if you want English, no frill... 
simply choose a specific English you like, if you want 2 English 
(strange, uncommon but possible) do both specific or one of them specific..., 
anyway Language Switcher must follow it. 
If you have two English you want they would be different. 
So, considering only first column you may have two rows: en/en-US or en/en-GB 
It seems to me flexible and quite simple to implement and manage... 
I getting some weird problem with GUI interface (in attach a preview) so I downgraded it 
to single string... just for have it working quickly..., GUI interface is available for testing. 
Dig in to the portal setting code to find it ;)
Note: Most of this code was moved to esperantus. You can use it on any site.

-FIX: Removed VS 2003 solution. If you want to use VS 2003 just open 2002 solution and convert it.
      Sorry but I CANNOT KEEP IN SYNC 2 solutions.
-FIX: Removed secure/gateway email. It is not finished and give errors when compiled with mk.bat.

1.2.8.1720e - 24/06/2003
by Mario
- ENH: I have added new features in SimpleMenu module (ItemMenu, same behavior like ShopNavigation but can bind to all bindings.)

- ENH: In the LanguageSwitcher module i have added the possibility to hide the Labels behind the Flags.
*********************** IMPORTANT ******************
You are now able to itemize or categorize content in all modules using the itemID parameter like the Product module.
Be carefull adding the Dhtml menus on a deskoplayout always including a dhtml menu, it will fail (there can be only one HVMenu.)

1.2.8.1720d - 24/06/2003
by Ender (Credits go to Mark Brown)
- FIX: When another control is on page and a postback from that occurs calendar doesn't draw

1.2.8.1720c - 21/06/2003
by Manu
- Nice country list in portalsettings.

1.2.8.1720b - 21/06/2003
by john.mandia@whitelightsolutions.com
-ENH: Used the new Ballon Settings added by Manu to add the English Name and Description to some of the MetaSettings I added earlier (TabTitle, TabUrlKeyword, 
      TabMetaKeyWords, TabMetaDescription, TabMetaEncoding, TabMetaOther & TabKeyPhrase) for PortalSettings.cs and TabSettings.cs.
-Note: Please check the reference for Esperantus when you are compiling as it is dependant on where rainbow is on your system. Check the references folder in 
       VS.NET to see that it can see the dll. If not you will need to re-reference it.  

1.2.8.1720a - 21/06/2003
by Thierry (Tiptopweb)
- ENH: DesktopLayout / Themes can be set differently on EACH tab (Tab Settings)!
       If nothing is set, the DesktopLayout / Themes of the portal are used
       The desktopLayout swich is in DesktopDefault.aspx
       The Theme switch is in PortalSettings when getting the CurrentTheme
       (the theme is not optimal as the theme file will be read for each module instead of being read
        once when reading portalsettings - nothing is changed if you do not use the theme settings on a tab)
- FIX: removed from DesktopDefault.aspx the switch in Layout for the Shop
*********************** IMPORTANT ******************
If you are using a Products module: you will need to set an appropriate DesktopLayout for the shop
on the tab holding the Product module : for example MenuMsShop (it is using shopnavigation instead of menunavigation)
This is because it is not hardcoded anymore in DesktopDefault.aspx :)
****************************************************

       Added GatewayManager. 
       Now gateways can be simply added to web.config, even in different dll.
   
*********************** IMPORTANT CHANGE **********************************
- ENH: I have changed the way resources are stored. 
       This is a big step in semplifying the resource management. 
       Now you can simply comple Rainbow using visual studio. 
       No need for a separate compilation for resources.
  These are the changes:
  1) The localized resources are stored in Rainbow.resources.dll and no more on Language.resources.dll
  2) Resources are compiled using Visual Studio. 
     You may still use the updated compileme.bat in Resource folder to compile resources 
     without the need of visual studio.
  3) Installer manages these resources automatically.
  4) You must upgrade you web.config if you use manual configuration:
	 AssemblyName=Rainbow.dll;KeysSubStore=Rainbow.Resources.Rainbow;
  5) If you add a new resource file in Resources for support a new language
     you must remember to add to VS project.
  6) Esperantus data layer is pluggable so you do not see any other change.

- FIX: I have upgraded Esperantus.dll to the lates version 1.0.2.0382. 
       This includes:
       ENH: New setting: AutoLearnIgnoreSaveErrors
       ENH: New setting: AutoLearnIgnoreEmptyKeys
       ENH: New setting: ConvertToUpper. Keys are transformed in Upper case.

by Jes1111
- FIX: Corrected SelectedIndex bug in LanguageSwitcher DataList

1.2.8.1718 - 03/06/2003
by Manu
- *********************** IMPORTANT CHANGE **********************************
  From version 1718 Rainbow use Esperantus as localization engine.
  All Rainbow.Globalization code is now on Esperantus.
  
  Esperantus is an indepentent project, Open source
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/esperantus/
  
  Esperantus can be used in non-Rainbow sites.  

  Esperantus configuration can be found on web.config - Esperantus section
 
  You MUSTchange you configuration path to your language stores.

  <add key="KeysStoreParameters" 
       value="AssemblyName=C:\Dev\CVSROOT\Rainbow\bin\Language.dll;
              KeysSubStore=Rainbow;Path=C:\Dev\CVSROOT\Rainbow\Resources;
              FilesPrefix=Rainbow" 
  />

  AssemblyName=C:\Dev\CVSROOT\Rainbow\bin\Language.dll
  must point ot language dll in your bin dir

  Path=C:\Dev\CVSROOT\Rainbow\Resources
  must point to Resources dire on your Rainbow dir

  
  I have made the needed changes on Rainbow.
  If you have custom code you have to do some changes:
  
  <%@ Import Namespace="Esperantus" %> 
  becomes 
  <%@ Import Namespace="Esperantus" %>

  using Esperantus; 
  becomes
  using Esperantus;
  
  <%@ Register TagPrefix="tra" Namespace="Esperantus.WebControls" Assembly="Rainbow" %>
  becomes
  <%@ Register TagPrefix="tra" Namespace="Esperantus.WebControls" Assembly="Esperantus" %>
  
  Esperantus.WebControls.xxx (all controls)
  becomes
  Esperantus.WebControls.xxx (all controls)
  
  Rainbow.Globalization.Localize.GetCurrentLanguage()
  becomes
  Esperantus.Localize.GetCurrentUINeutralCultureName()
  GetCurrentLanguage was used for retrieve the current language of the ui, in Esperantus
  this is more precise. It exposes GetCurrentUINeutralCultureName() and GetCurrentNeutralCultureName()
  
  Rainbow.Globalization.Localize.GetCurrentRegion()
  becomes
  Esperantus.CountryInfo.CurrentCountry
  Esperantus now has a dedicated object for manage Countries infos.
  Esperantus.CountryInfo.Current tries to get a valid country from CurrentLanguage culture.
  If a Country that matches current Culture cannot be found a null value is returned.
  
  GetCountries and GetStates are now modified. They return now an array of CoutryInfo objects.
  The list has no changes. Data are still get from SQL database befcause Esperantus
  supports custom conutries lists. You will see no changes in RegisterFull.acx control bahavior.
  A new view named: Esperantus_CountryList provides the list. Database is defined in Esperantus section
  in web.config. Be sure CountryRegionsStoreParameters matches your SQL database (this connection string
  is totally independent from you main connection string and gives you a great flexibility).
  
  Resources now are store on Resurce folder in Ms resx xml format.
  
  You compile resources using complang.bat - open file and be sure that path is pointing to
  you current Net Framework environment.
  
  SQL Localize table is not removed. Anyway it is not used.
  Esperantus Autolearn adds keys in your Resource/Rainbow.resx file.
  
  Use Esperantus tools for mange resources in *.resx format.
  You can import/export from/to Access mdb file.

- ENH: PortalsDb (new portals creation): Add language switcher to available modules

1.2.8.1714d - 25/05/2003
By Jes1111
- *********************** IMPORTANT CHANGE **********************************
  Auto placement of Signin and LanguageSwitch modules disabled. Use new
  "ShowEverywhere" setting on first placed instance of either module
  to make them show up on all pages. For the Signin module, set its view
  permissions to Unauthenticated Users and Admins + uncheck All Users. 
  Since you won't get a signin module showing up when you first run Rainbow
  after this update, use Rainbow/Admin/Logon.aspx to signin as Admin.
  IMPORTANT: we need to produce a script or whatever to add a Signin module
  to the first tab of a fresh portal -- can someone help me with this? I'm
  a complete klutz in the SQL department.
  ***************************************************************************
- Signin (all flavours) and LanguageSwitcher modules are now regular
  placeable modules -- associated settings have been removed from Site Settings.
  Note that LangList, CultureList, LangLock and LangUser are still in the
  Site Settings table, since they are needed/useful even if you only run
  one language. LanguageSwitcher documentation will be updated soon.
- Modified SettingsTable so it now orders and groups Portal and
  Module settings insteading of showing one big list. Groups and order within 
  Groups is set by specifying in the constructor. New SettingItem property Group
  and enumerator SettingItemGroup. Site Settings and shared Module settings have been 
  modified to group properly. I've modified HtmlModule to show how it is done for 
  a module, but I'm delaying updating all the other modules pending some other
  forthcoming changes. Any module that has not been updated to use the new
  scheme will look "a bit messy" on its settings screen, but it all still works.
  Group headings are "localized", but waiting for Esperantus to enter translations, 
  so the text key shows up at the moment.
- Added "Print this..." button. Activated in Module Settings. Core stuff is solid, 
  but so far I've only done a minimal implementation of the actual  print page. 
  PrintHeader and PrintFooter templates added to all Layouts. If you
  have a custom layout, you'll need to duplicate from a standard layout as a starting
  point. Print button image added to all Themes (plus some others). Seems to work
  for all the modules I've tried, although "active" modules, i.e. with edit links, etc
  showing break if you click the link in the print page. Even works for shortcuts if 
  you set the Print button "on" in the original.
- Added "Back" button - this is for modules which can change their view - of which
  there are none at the moment! My forthcoming XML Item Manager uses it.
- Some code added, but commented out for the moment, to implement "Email this..." and
  "Help" buttons. I'll be discussing these in the list.
- Some interior changes to XmlLangModule - still functions the same.
- Modified GetPortalCustomSettings() in PortalSettings.cs, so it doesn't read in 
  "rogue/redundant" settings -- this seemed safer than producing a script to delete 
  them from db. Thoughts?

1.2.8.1712c - 17/05/2003
- john.mandia@whitelightsolutions.com
- Implemented footer [PLEASE NOTE IF YOU HAVE A CUSTOM LAYOUT YOU NEED TO INCLUDE A FOOTER NOW]
- Tided up some of the html (Added head tag to some pages so that head file wouldn't automatically be written into the body tag)
- Introduced 4 new rb_css values:
       - rb_AlternatePortalHeader (css that is applied to the td that contains portalbanner ascx file) 
       - rb_DefaultPortalHeader (css that is applied to the td that contains portalbanner ascx file)
       - rb_AlternatePortalFooter(css that is applied to the td that contains portalfooter ascx file)
       - rb_DefaultPortalFooter(css that is applied to the td that contains portalfooter ascx file)
	[PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU WILL NEED TO INCLUDE THESE IN YOUR CUSTOM THEMES]
	Default css is basically for casual views where as Alternate is for admin type pages 
        (In case someone wants to give a different look depending on the function of the page)
- Slight change to survey module so that it spaces out questions a bit nicer
- Introduced Code that was implemented by Jason and Mario, Adds new menu binding options and also keeps track 
  of relationships (parent tab, sub tab, sub sub tab etc) which means you can have both the top and subtab highlighted.
  Changed files: BindEnum.cs, DesktopNavigation.cs, MenuNavigation.cs these were mainly additions and should not affect anyones code.

by Manu
- FIX: Fixed multiselect list data type. Now handles correctly null values.

       So you may select one or multiple language.
	   To see it click on edit properties on any module.
	   Invariant culture is neutral (the module is always shown)
	   The list comes from currently selected languages in portal settings.
       Sample: If you select both Italian and French languages you see Italian and French.
       Known issue: if you select any language other than Invariant (neutral language, 
                    it matches any language) only specific culture is shown.
       Sample: If you select both Invariant and French languages you see French only.

  Before: <cc2:Paging id="pgPictures" runat="server" />

  protected Rainbow.UI.WebControls.IPaging pgPictures;
- ENH: Added option for show language switcher in horizontal

  culture matches current language module is showed. Otherwise is hidden.
  On TabLayout page you see all modules as usual.

- Fix: Fixed themes so they do not show a white border at the top by default.
       There was a problem with the css and the html (table margins had to be

       applied (Otherwise it would default to margin 3 - Thanks Jes for pointing out 
       the css stuff).
- Tidied up some of the html (There was colspan="2" in a few places where it wasnt needed).

- By john.mandia@whitelightsolutions.com:
- Removed hardcoded values for table width and alignment and the body tag 
  So that it can be controlled 100% by your themes. Table now has 
  a css reference and is wrapped by a div tag (for browser compatibility).
- There are two groups of css styles added to the css file (You need to add this to your custom themes).
  1) .rb_DefaultLayoutDiv & .rb_DefaultLayoutTable 
  2) .rb_AlternateLayoutDiv & .rb_AlternateLayoutTable
  Group 1 is used on general pages and Group 2 is used on Admin Pages 
  (In case you wish to have more width for your admin pages)
- I have added a new theme MSDefault76 where it demonstrates a width of 76% centered 
  (Please not if you place objects that are bigger than that then it will stretch). 
  I have also updated all the old themes so that they still appear the same (width 100%).

1.2.8.1624a - 24/04/2003
By Jes1111
- New module CacheViewer - for admin/dev use to see contents of Rainbow cache.
  Shows key, size and contents (sorted by key). Add to any page, but remember 
  that Admin user will not add anything to cache so you need to log out to see it happening.
- Changed Module CacheKey to add PortalAlias - helps identify modules in CacheViewer in
  multi-portal setup.
- New module XmlLangModule - extension of original XML/XSLT module, but works with
  LanguageSwitcher. Full documentation to follow. Includes new XslHelper.cs which is
  passed in to XSLT to give access to selected Rainbow methods and properties. 
  Sales2.xml and Sales2.xsl in _Rainbow/xml folder demonstrate functionality - set 
  LangList="en;fr;pt" and CultureList="en-US;fr-FR;pt-PT" in Site Settings. 
  NOTE: Module Title not localized (yet).
- Improved cache behaviour: CacheTime=-1 is now a legitimate value, rather than a 
  happy accident.
- Added bool "Cacheable" property to modules - forces CacheTime to -1 to prevent caching
  of all instances of module type. See PortalSearch.ascx.cs for demonstration of disabling
  caching. No DB update - "Cacheable = false" is hard-coded into module code. Also disables 
  CacheTime field on ModuleSettings page. Use when module type should never be cached.
- Fixed Designer problem with Cache (reported in Forum).

  PortalSettings.cs, DesktopPanes.cs and web.config files.
  Enables fine-grained control of UI language, content language 
  culture-sensitive formatting, for single- as well as multiple-
  language portals. PDF document in /DeskTopModules explains all.
  Demonstration language-sensitive XML/XSL module coming soon!
- Related to above, new folder "images/flags" in application root.
- Related changes to cache behavior to support multiple languages.
- NOTE: I've had to temporarily disable caching of portalSettings:
  classic Catch-22 situation until static data is separated from
  dynamic data.
- NOTE: big clash here on encoding (see 1.2.8.1919b below), since
  iso-8859-1 does not appear to support the Euro symbol. See comment
  in web.config file.
- Added DesktopTabsXml (XPathDocument) property to PortalSettings. This
  is an indirect serialization of the existing DesktopTabs property. It
  has no use at present unless you want to implement a third-party menuing
  system as I have, but it might be interesting for others to look at.
- Added KeywordSplitter function to HttpUrlBuilder - see comments in 
  Rainbow.config file.

by Ender
- I've fixed smtg in Tab and TabLayout (admin) modules that 
  has been annoying me for sometime. 
  You know when you hit the up or down arrow in these pages, 
  module or tabs' order is changed. But the selection gets lost. 
  In other words if you want to move a tab to TWO upper levels, you need to 
   1. Select the tab from the list
   2. Hit the up button
   3. Select the tab AGAIN
   4. Hit the up button
  It gets really annoying if you need to move a tab all the way up/down in the list.

1.2.8.1505 - 05/03/2003
- Improved and fixed core localization code (localize class).
  Now it is really clean.
  In the next few days we will replace all legacy localization 
  code on modules and aspx pages. 
  
  The new mode use:
  - SQL or MSDE instead of Access
  - Defines a culture table
  - Updates Countries and States list
  - Include all available translations
  - Has Autolearning feature to track key usage and insert 
    provided translations on db (no autotranslation like google, it
    inserts the text that the module creator defines)
  - Include a consistent way to see how the keys are used (Sections table)
  - New webconfig key:
  
  	<!-- 
	The autolearn features fills up the database
	with missing localized keys and updates usage.
	Suggestion: turn off on production sites.
	Very usefull for module creators and translators.
		-->
	<add key="AutoLearn" value="true" />

- Great changes on db, you cannot go back!
  
  Look ad DBinstall folder.
  The files are zipped to prevent CVS changes!
  
  - Install 1.1.x - This is for new database only
  - Upgrade 1.1.x to 1.2.8.1505 - Upgrade to this version.
  
  IMPORTANT: The upgrade cannot be repeated safely.
  BACKUP YOUR DB, take notice of any ERROR (ignore warnings)
  and post on forums any problem.
  
  From now on all patches will be intended for upgrading one
  version to another.

- The patch drops [rblang_Language] table. Save any custom data
  BEFORE applying the patch.

  http://localhost/rainbow/Admin/Logon.aspx?usr=admin&pwd=admin&alias=demo

  procedure like HtmlModule

  No need for separate translation routines: just use the new label 
  or literal control and set the TextKey property

Modules
- New articles module (still unfinished)

Pages

- Predefined text for button is provided so you have to change only if different.
  Property URL is built in so is always shown. 
  If you want to hide in some module you should set the URL as empty.
- Page.cs completely rewritten for a better performance. Now the elements
  are retrieved only if needed. Many changes in derivate classes to conform
  to new page implementation. Can be some little bug. Please let me know if something is wrong.

- Rewritten HTML edit module to use new Yahe control (source included wit permission).

Cory changes:

Tabsettings and page
john.mandia@whitelightsolutions.com changes:
  - New table TabSettings and new classes for add/edit custom tab settings
  - New head implementation in page.cs supporting css, metadata 
    and other search engines facilities. All settings can be
    modified per portal base (defaults for all the portal) and per
    tab basis if needed.
    
There are two settings in tab custom settings you might not understand
TabKeyPhrase and TabUrlKeyword
TabUrlKeyword is to give people the option of having a keyword added 
to their url helps people distinguish sections easier and makes 
search engines index better (only slightly though) so if one tab 
was about us you could enter about-us then when someone 
goes to the url it is more recognisable
TabKeyPhrase is a bit trickier, the reason for this is again 
search engine optimisation and this one is for theme builders 
the TabKeyPhrase is to go at the top of the page just after body 
or close after before any script or code etc. 
The reason being that search engines give priority to where text 
is placed if you have your keyphrase at the top it will read it 
first and think it is the main thing the page is about 
www.pharmaceutical-industry.info on my current site it is used on 
every page before the tables etc and it looks like part of the site.

- Breadcrumbs update Ver. 1.1 - 31. jan 2003 by jes
  I made some crude changes to the breadcrumbs control. 
  First, there was a problem that it didn't pick up the TabIndex, so I changed that. 
  Plus, I didn't like that it made the current page a clickable link, so I changed that. 
  Then I wanted it in a table so I could control it's formatting a bit more,

1.1.7.1203
- Now the multiportal option via querystring run smoothly
  Type rainbow/desktopdefault.aspx?alias=<yourportalalias> to switch portal
  If you are logged on automatically you will be logged off from the current portal
  and need to reconnect. It is recommended anyway to close browser if you want to 
  move from one portal to another. Some problems may be with IE cache that thinks to be
  on the formerly portal. Anyway one refresh or two could help.
- Fixed missing procedure in discussion module
- Fixed loading XML docs in XML module
- Added Documents dir to CVS in base _rainbow portal dir
- Improved shortcuts (single and all) for a better readability.
  Now everything should work. There are some issues left with modules that save custom data
  in their own dir (xml, documents). Now the only way to share modules between different 
  portals is to use the same dir for all portals.
