=Commit conventions=

Please keep the following commit convention.

==Сautions==
 
 * Do not commit anything outside your sandbox root.
 * Avoid commiting large files.
 * Avoid commiting the redundant files, regardless of their size. Such as:
   * files that can be built from sources in the repository
   * files that are local for your environment ({{{*.suo, *.??proj.user}}} etc, see below)

==Global ignores==

^How to locally svn:ignore frequently ignored stuff without changing any property in the repository^

No need to explicitely ignore frequently ignored stuff. 

You can use global config.
You can find it in *%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Subversion\config* file  on Windows 
systems.

You have to find the section *{{{[miscellany]}}}* and uncomment the *{{{global-ignores}}}* key

For *ASP.Net* and other *.Net* development it is recommended to ignore the following list of signatures:

{{{
global-ignores = bin obj _old Bin *.suo *.user *.db Thumbs.db *.pdb *.csproj.user *.pdb
}}}
