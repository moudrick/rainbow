#summary Rules for contributor to comply.
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

*Rainbow Portal* is an open source project. It contains works of a lot of contributors. They can even not be acquainted to each other. But their actions have to be organized and not prejudice each other's work. So we are developing a couple of rules for all contributor to comply.

The first step of organization is the RepositoryStructure. To contribute the source code developers have to be fluent in it. You will know from there what is *devint trunk*. Also developers have to learn the SubversionNotes to follow the best practices.

Every cheap copy of the devint trunk (such as trunks in sandboxes, branches and tags) 
should have full information to build and test all possible configurations of Rainbow. To achieve this we need a kind of DNA in the main trunk to be used in all cheap copies. 
This is done by RootFiles in the devint trunk. It performs all required actions including update, build, database and web application creation and auto-tests targets. This make us close to nightly (latest) builds download for Rainbow Portal to be a mighty project.

To be continued.
