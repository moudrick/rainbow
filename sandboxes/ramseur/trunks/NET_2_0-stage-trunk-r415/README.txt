Note : This is a Beta Release and should by no means be
       deployed into production as this is a Preview.  If
       the user of this Rainbow Beta 1 deploys in production,
       the Rainbow portal team nor its community will be 
       held liable for issues or downtime.  This software is for developers
       and CMS website owners who would like to see what
       is in store for Rainbow 2.0.

Known Issues:

   Little bugs with ASPNETDB will occur as we slowly integrate this 
new membership layer into Rainbow.  Zen doesnt work with rewrite currently
as code needs to be migrated + bugs fixed.  Please use the classic themes
for now.
