Look and feel
Improved Zen theme engine by Jeremy Esland
Added new demo themes (screenshot)
Better Caching handling (no need of Cache Manager anymore)
Now each module may have its own css and current theme may override it

ZEN laytous options:
There are two properties on the ZenNavigation control 
"UsePathTraceInUrl" - true by default
"UsePageNameInUrl" - also true by default
set both to false to use standard friendly pagename instead

ZEN known issue:
Using ZEN menu as in the default skin zenexample on a very large site (more than 1000 pages)
in IE can have a big load on CPU.
It is not recommended to use ZEN menu on large sites.
It is an IE issue, Firefox works correctly.

Bug Fixes
A lot of old and new bug fixed

Breaking changes!

Big rename from Tab to Page in code.
Old Tab methods still availabe for backward compatibility.
However:

Change in allDesktopLayouts that refers to TabStripDetails class to PageStripDetails

example:
search for (usually used on DesktopPortalBanner.aspx)
<a href="<%#Rainbow.HttpUrlBuilder.BuildUrl(((Rainbow.Configuration.TabStripDetails) Container.DataItem).TabID)%>"><%# ((Rainbow.Configuration.TabStripDetails) Container.DataItem).TabName %></a>
and replace with:
<a href="<%#Rainbow.HttpUrlBuilder.BuildUrl(((Rainbow.Configuration.PageStripDetails) Container.DataItem).PageID)%>"><%# ((Rainbow.Configuration.PageStripDetails) Container.DataItem).PageName %></a>

or you get an error like this:
System.Web.HttpUnhandledException: Generata eccezione di tipo System.Web.HttpUnhandledException. ---> System.InvalidCastException: Cast specificato non valido.
   at ASP.DesktopPortalBanner_ascx.__DataBind__control10(Object sender, EventArgs e) in C:\Dev\Rainbow\SVN\DEV\Design\DesktopLayouts\OldTabsMenuHWLeft\DesktopPortalBanner.ascx:line 79
